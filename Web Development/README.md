# Web Developer `Roadmap`

Below are the learning paths and technologies that you should follow if you want to become a web developer or a Full Stack Developer.

### Things you should know at first!

These are the technologies and tools that you need to know or learn properly if you want to get into web development.

* Git - Version Control System
* GitHub
* Basic Terminal Usage
* Data Structures and Algorithm
* SSH
* HTTP/HTTPS

### Choose a Path to learn `First`

Choose any of the following to start at first!

* Front-end
* Back-end


### Front-end

#### The Basics

* **HTML & CSS:**
HTML and CSS are the backbones of any website. HTML provides the structure while CSS provides the style and help them to look better and more visually appealing. If you want to become a serious frontend developer then you must master these two and to start with.

<br />
* **JavaScript:**
The first two provides structure and style but it’s the JavaScript which makes them alive by adding interactiveness.

#### CSS Frameworks

* **Bootstrap:**
Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components.<br />
* **Materialize CSS:**
Materialize CSS implements all the material design concepts and makes it easy for you to use.
Created and designed by Google, Material Design is a design language that combines the classic principles of successful design along with innovation and technology. Google's goal is to develop a system of design that allows for a unified user experience across all their products on any platform.
<br />
* **Semantic UI**
Semantic allows developers to build beautiful websites fast, with concise HTML, intuitive javascript, and simplified debugging, helping make front-end development a delightful experience. Semantic is responsively designed allowing your website to scale on multiple devices.

#### Package Managers

* **NPM:**
`npm` is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. It consists of a command line client, also called npm, and an online database of public and paid-for private packages, called the npm registry.

* **YARN:**
`Yarn` is a new package manager for node.js. It is a common project developed by such companies as Facebook, Exponent, Google, and Tilde. It is distributed under the BSD license. At the time of writing this post, the current Yarn version is 0.17.10.
The main reason why developers choose to transition to Yarn is its stability. In the case of npm, when we need to deploy the project on different machines, the versions of installed packages can be different. I think that was the reason Yarn appeared in the first place.

#### Linters and Formatters
 * **Prettier**
 * **ESLint**
 * **JSHint**
 * **JSLint**

 #### Task Runners
 * **npm scripts**
 * **gulp.js**

 #### Module Bundlers
 * **Webpack** 
 
 Now, After Learning this much, it's time to pick up a framework or library of frontend to work further.

 #### Framework or Library

 * **React.js:**
    RxJS
 * **Angular**
    ngRx
 * **Vue.js**
    vueX

#### Testing your app

Now, it's time to test your website to make sure everything is fine!
To do this we use certain tools available for free to use.

* Mocha
* Chai
* Karma
* Jest
* Enzyme

###### Types of testing

* Unit
* Integration
* Functional

#### Server Side Rendering
* **Python**
* **Ruby**
* **PHP**
* **Node.js**

For the beginners, if you are just getting into backend development, we would recommend you to pick one of the scripting languages. For the quick-and-easy, go with Node.js or PHP.

#### Learn Relational Database

A relational database is a set of formally described tables from which data can be accessed or reassembled in many different ways without having to reorganize the database tables.

* **Oracle**
* **MySQL**
* **MariaDB**
* **PostgreSQL**
* **MSSQL**

#### Learn a FrameWork 
* **For PHP - Laravel or Symfony**
* **For Node.js - Express.js, Hapi.js**
* **For GO - I prefer to code without framework**

#### Learn NoSQL Database
First understand what they are and how they are different from relational database and why they are needed.There are several different options.

* **MongoDB**
* **RethinkDB**
* **Cassandra**
* **Couchbase**

#### Create RESTful APIs 
A RESTful API is an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data. Understand REST and learn how to make RESTful APIs.

#### Authentication/Authorization 
Learn about the differences and how to implement them 
* **OAuth**
* **Basic Authentication**
* **Token Authentication**
* **JWT**
* **OpenID**

#### Knowledge of Web Servers
* **Apache**
* **Nginx**
* **Caddy**
* **MS IIS**
