# Introduction to Android Skill Track/Roadmap Update

### 1. Greeting and Introduction

Hello everyone! Welcome to the exciting journey of enhancing your Android development skills. In this updated skill track, we will explore the evolving landscape of Android development, transitioning from traditional XML-based UI objects to the world of declarative UI with Android Compose and Relay.

### Why Compose?
The modern Android Developemnt, brings a lot of features and Developer experience improvements, features such as composable funtions, reuasble UI componenets, State-recomposition. It also brings performance to table as for competitive development in competitions, native will be more practical in terms of 

#### Embracing the Future of UI Development

The Android ecosystem is undergoing a significant transformation. Google is leading the way by shifting from XML-based UI objects to a declarative UI paradigm with Android Compose. This evolution represents a fundamental change in how we create user interfaces for Android applications. It's a move from describing the "how" (imperative) to describing the "what" (declarative).



### 3. Introduction of Compose and Relay

#### Meet Android Compose

Android Compose is the cornerstone of this transformation. It's a modern UI toolkit that lets you build native Android interfaces declaratively. With Compose, you describe your UI based on the current state of your app, and the framework handles the rest. Compose empowers developers to create interactive, dynamic, and visually stunning UIs with less code and more flexibility.

#### The Role of Relay

In this journey, we'll also introduce you to Relay, which plays a vital role as an intersection of UI design and application design, relay helps you to bring your design assets straight from figma, directly to android studio and use it in your project as if they were standard material components 

### 4. Refreshed Skill Track

#### Why Update the Skill Track?

Our commitment to your growth as an Android developer drives us to update our skill track continually. This update will reflect the most up-to-date knowledgebase in Android development, aligning with the industry's evolving standards.
