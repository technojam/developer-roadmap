# Android Developer Roadmap

Below are the steps you can follow to be android developer.

## Prerequisites/Requirements

###### These are the technologies you must know to enter into the field of android development.
* Git – VCS
* GitHub
*	Basic terminal commands (Nano & Vim)
*	DS and algo will be plus (Basics)
*	Java/Kotlin (Logic & Backend)
*	XML (UI & Frontend)

## Path

###### * Front-end
###### * Back-end

## Front-end

XML (extensible mark-up language)
XML was designed to store and transport data. But here it serves the purpose for designing each and every component of ui. It makes your app look more attractive.


## Back-end/ Logic

1.	Java
Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

2.	Kotlin
Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java
3.	Gradle
In Android Studio, Gradle is a custom build tool used to build android packages (apk files) by managing dependencies and providing custom build logic. APK file (Android Application package) is a specially formatted zip file which contains. Byte code. Resources (images, UI, xml etc)


## Tools
•	JDK (Java Development Kit)
•	Android Studio
•	AVD/Android phone



## From an Idea to Playstore
•	Discovery & wireframing—Establish a blueprint of your app’s content that hinges on excellent UX and user interface (UI) design.
•	Design & software planning—Using Android Studio, a developer could create the Android User Interface with the Material Design guidelines. At the same time, they’ll create a cohesive plan for the software architecture of your app.
•	Coding & integration—With your app’s front-end architectures coded, next any back-end components (a database, APIs, middleware, etc.) are integrated.
•	Testing—Unit testing, integration testing, and debugging save time and can prevent extensive rewrites to fix buggy code.
•	Preparation & publishing—Your app gets prepped as a release-ready APK, uploaded to the Developer Console, then published to Google Play.
