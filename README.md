# Developer Roadmap
![logo](https://github.com/siAyush/developer-roadmap/blob/master/dev.jpg)



## Contributing Rules
1. Put all field related resources and pathway or roadmap inside a directory.


    for ex: if you're adding web developer roadmap, then, add a directory `web development` then add your files inside this directory.

2. You can't add same field again like- you can't add another web developer roadmap if there's already one. Instead what you should do is, contribute in that directory or existing roadmap.
